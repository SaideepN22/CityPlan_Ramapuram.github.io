                <li>
                    What are the kinds of problems we see in nature? (iteration, recursion, backtracking)
                    <p class="ans">We can observe many different problems in nature that we can relate to iterations and backtracking. One such example would be the change in seasons, which happens in a cycle throughout the year, which we can relate to an iteration. The growth of cabbage leaves, forming layers, can be related to recursion, and the ants exploring their whole territory and returning back to their home can be related to backtracking. There are various other instances in nature that can be related to iterations, recursion, and backtracking.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    What is space and time efficiency? Why are they important? Explain the different classes of problems and orders of growth.
                    <p class="ans">Space Complexity: Is the extra space taken by an algorithm to execute. Time complexity: Time taken by an algorithm to execute is called time complexity. Space and time complexity are important for evaluating the efficiency of algorithms. They help programmers understand how an algorithm performs and whether it is suitable for specific applications. The orders of growth of an algorithm describe how time or space requirements grow as the input size increases.
                        <br> O(1) -> constant order of growth <br> O(n) -> linear order of growth <br> O(log n) -> logarithmic order of growth
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Take away from different design principles from chapter 2?
                    <p class="ans">After studying different algorithms, the key ideas started to make sense. Learning how AVL trees and Red-Black trees maintain balance highlighted the importance of structures in data and efficient operations. Comparing brave and cautious travel to DFS and BFS in graph traversal showed how different strategies can solve problems effectively. Finally, understanding how various sorting algorithms work, such as dividing and merging or swapping elements, helped to understand their logic. In all, these concepts have provided a solid foundation for the principles of algorithms.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The hierarchical data and how different tree data structures solve and optimize over problem scenarios (tree, bst, avl, 2-3, red-black, heap, trie)
                    <p class="ans">Tree data structures help organize hierarchical data efficiently and solve various problems. Binary search trees improve searching by ordering the roots, but they are not balanced. A 2-3 tree is a self-balancing tree designed to keep operations efficient by keeping all leaf nodes at the same level, but this still introduces skewness in the tree. Hence, we moved towards the AVL tree, which was balanced based on a balancing factor and rotations. Further, to reduce the number of rotations, we moved to the Red-Black tree. Heap is a complete binary tree that ensures the heap property. Heaps are good for priority queues. A Trie is a tree data structure primarily used for storing strings. Tries are used for tasks like autocomplete and prefix search.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    The need for array query algorithms and their implications. Their applications and principles need to be discussed.
                    <p class="ans">Array queries are necessary for efficiently handling large amounts of data with frequent updates. Lookup tables are good for precomputing and storing results to allow fast retrieval during range queries. Segment trees are versatile structures and useful for efficient updates. An alternative to these is BIT with simpler code for range queries, operating on the principle of isolating the last bit.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Differentiate between tree and graphs and their traversals. The applications of each.
                    <p class="ans">Trees and graphs are both structures used to organize data, but they differ in many ways. A tree is a hierarchical structure with one root node and no cycles, whereas a graph is a set of nodes connected together by edges, and it can have cycles.
                        <br>Tree traversal:<br> 1. Pre-order<br> 2. In-order<br> 3. Post-order<br><br>
                        Graph traversal:<br> 1. DFS (Depth First Search): Brave Traversal<br> 2. BFS (Breadth First Search): Cautious Traversal<br><br>
                        Trees are used for representing hierarchical data and for searching the shortest path and sorting. Graphs are used in applications for finding the shortest path.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Deliberate on sorting and searching algorithms, the technique behind each and how they connect to the real world.
                    <p class="ans">Sorting and searching algorithms are important for organizing and finding data efficiently, with many real-world uses. Sorting algorithms like quick sort and merge sort arrange data in order, which is helpful in tasks like organizing products for e-commerce websites. Searching algorithms like binary search locate specific items, used in search engines and e-commerce websites.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discuss the importance of graph algorithms with respect to spanning trees and shortest paths.
                    <p class="ans">Graphs are important with respect to spanning trees to calculate MST (Minimum Spanning Tree), which is used to connect all the nodes in the graph with the least cost, making it useful for laying roads and pipelines. Shortest path algorithms, such as Dijkstra's, help in finding the quickest or shortest way to travel between nodes, which is useful in GPS navigation apps.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Discuss the different studied algorithm design techniques.
                    <p class="ans">Different algorithms studied:<br>1. Backtracking: It involves exploring all possible solutions and pruning the ones that do not lead to a solution, learned with the example of the N-queens problem.<br><br>2. Sorting Algorithms: <br> i. Divide and conquer: Quick and Merge Sort<br> ii. Comparison-Based: Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort.<br><br> 3. Brute force: Solving a problem by trying all possible solutions one-by-one.<br><br> 4. String search algorithms: <br> i. Boyer-Moore<br> ii. Knuth-Morris-Pratt<br> iii. Rabin-Karp<br><br> 5. Shortest path algorithms: <br> i. Dijkstra's<br> ii. Floyd's<br> iii. Warshall's<br> iv. Prim's</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Providing Affordable Clean Energy Solutions is 
                            necessary for a developing city as it promotes 
                            sustainable development and reduces the dependency
                             on fossil fuels. This also supports economic growth
                            by creating job opportunities and provides a reliable, 
                            long term cost efficient source of energy.  

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For implementing an Affordable Clean Energy Solutions business, 
                            there are various different algorithms that can be used to make 
                            the business run more efficiently. We can represent the whole distribution
                            network as a graph with nodes as power grids and houses to which the energy 
                            must be supplied, and the routes for this transmission are the edges.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We can make use of <b>Prim's algorithm</b> to find the MST (minimum spanning tree) to 
                            lay down the routes for energy distribution at the lowest cost possible. We are 
                            using Prim's over Kruskal's as the graph network with the edges as cables between 
                            the houses and power grids is dense with many cables (edges) hence, Prim's is a better
                             algorithm to find the MST in a dense graph.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Next, we can use shortest path algorithms like <b>Dijkstra's algorithm</b> to optimize the location 
                            of the power grids, and for efficient distribution of energy to all the houses, we can take the
                            main power station as the source node and apply Dijkstra's on the graph representation to find 
                            the shortest paths to distribute the energy from the source.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We can also use <b>sorting algorithms</b> to sort the areas based on the populations so that we can place
                             an appropriately sized grid based on the population.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            A <b>look-up table</b> is a data structure that stores pre-computed values for fast retrieval. 
                            This can be used to quickly access large amounts of data in the case of an energy distribution system. 
                            It can be used to retrieve the energy consumption data of a particular consumer or a building.

                        <li>
                            <b>BIT or Fenwick tree</b> works on the concept of isolating the last bit and is efficient in the case of range queries.
                            We are using BIT over segment trees as BIT is easier t implement due to its simple code.
                            BIT can be used to calculate the total energy consumption of a consumer over a specific time period.

                            As the city aims to become a self-sufficient, sustainable, and developed city, 
                            educational institutions play an important role in this process. For this, it is 
                            important to set up educational institutions across the entire city in such a way 
                            that they are accessible to all the people.

                        <li>
                            To achieve this, we will first analyze the total number of eligible students/people

                            The next step is to arrange the areas based on the number of people who will be accessing these institutions,

                             up in more populated areas based on the sorted list.

                             task is to set up a bus or pickup/drop service for all the students attending these institutions.
                        </li>
                        <li>For this, we need to design an efficient and cost-saving route for the buses to drop each student at their home. 
                            This can be done using an <b>all-pairs shortest path algorithm like Floyd's algorithm.</b> We can consider the institution
                             and the homes of each student as the nodes, and the roads connecting these areas as the edges, with weights as the travel cost.
                              By applying <b>Floyd's algorithm</b> to this graph representation, we can design the most efficient route for dropping off each student.
                        </li>
                        <li>Now that we have set up institutions in strategic locations accessible to all, it is important for these institutions to function in an 
                            organized manner to ensure a smooth and hassle-free experience. To achieve this, we need to keep a record of each student. This can be done
                             using an <b>array of structures</b> to store student information such as name, roll number, contact details, etc.
                        </li>
                        <li>For the admission process, we can use a <b>queue data structure</b> to provide admission on a first-come, first-served basis. Alternatively, we can 
                            sort the students based on their marks using a <b>sorting technique</b> and then provide admission based on the marks obtained by each student.
                        </li>

                            Other sensitive data regarding students, such as their Aadhaar number or parents' bank details, can be stored securely using <b>hashing algorithms.</b>

                    To implement this, we first need to store all the customer data,
                     for which we can use an <b>array of structures.</b> To ensure the correct

                        factor to consider is the credit scores, which determine whether loans are approved.
                         This can be done using <b>sorting algorithms</b> to sort the list based on credit scores.Further <b>hashing</b> can be used to store sensitive customer data securely.

                        <li>
                            Firstly, we can use <b>binary search</b> to search for products from a list of different products. We can also use tries for the autocomplete feature during typing in the search bar.

                        <li>
                            We can use <b>string matching algorithms like KMP and Rabin-Karp</b> to 
                            search for names of the products efficiently in the database. The 
                            next thing is that we can use <b>sorting algorithms</b> to sort the products
                             based on prices, ratings, and popularity. We can use <b>recommendation
                                engines</b> to recommend products to users based on their previous

                        <li>
                            Lastly, at the time of delivery, we can use shortest path algorithms like 
                            <b>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</b> to optimize delivery routes. This can be done by
                             considering the storage hub as the source node where all the products 
                             have been collected from different parts of the country and are ready
                              to be set out for delivery. The other nodes are the houses of the 
                              customers to whom the products need to be delivered. The routes
                               joining them are the edges, with weights as the cost of travel.

                            The first step is to identify the population density of each area.
                             This can be achieved using sorting techniques, such as <b>merge sort 
                                or quick sort</b>, to arrange the areas based on their population densities.
                              Once the areas are sorted, telecommunication towers can be strategically 
                              placed in locations that maximize network coverage, ensuring the towers
                               provide service to as many people as possible.

                            After placing the towers, the next step is to connect them to houses and other
                             towers through fiber optic cables. To do this efficiently, <b>Kruskal’s algorithm</b>
                              can be used to find the Minimum Spanning Tree . The MST helps connect all
                               nodes with the minimum total cost, reducing the expenses for laying cables.

                            of messages is maintained. This structure helps to organize message transfer 
                            efficiently without delays or reordering.
