                    <h2>What is the course about?</h2>
                    <p class="ans">➖Design and analysis of algorithms is more than a branch of computer science. It is the core of
                        computer science, and, in all fairness, can be said to be relevant to most of
                        science, business, and technology. The course is about understanding the interesting
                         patterns existing in nature as many natural processes can inspire computational algorithms and vice versa.
                         It helps in development of analytical thinking which can help in various problem solving strategies</p>
                    <h2>What kind of data structures and alogorithms have you studied?</h2>
                    <p class="ans">➖Exploring data structures feels like a journey 
                        through a fascinating family. From the continuity of memory 
                        blocks in arrays and strings to the interlinked nature of web 
                        pages seen in linked lists, each structure tells a story. Stacks 
                        and queues evoke everyday images of biscuit piles and waiting lines, 
                        while trees and tries expand our understanding into hierarchies and efficient searches. Skip lists, inspired by coin tosses, 
                        add an element of randomness with precision.</p>
                    <h2>How do you connect the course with real time applications?</h2>
                    <p class="ans">➖We are both aware and oblivious to the algorithms that permeate
                         our lives, much like the omnipresent air we breathe. Dijkstra’s Algorithm guides
                          us home through GPS, ensuring the quickest route, while sorting algorithms managing 
                          massive datasets in e-commerce platforms. These algorithms take complex challenges and 
                          carve them into elegant solutions, quietly enhancing our daily technological interactions and
                           making our digital experiences smoother and more intuitive. They are the invisible hands that 
                           optimize, protect, and personalize the technology we rely on every day</p>
